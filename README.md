# Offline Text Editor

## Description

- My motivation was to be able to use apps even when there is no internet connection.
- I build this project to be able to use a text editor without the need to be connected to the internet and to use it offline.
- It solves the problem of being able to work offline.
- I learned that apps can work offline and also online.
